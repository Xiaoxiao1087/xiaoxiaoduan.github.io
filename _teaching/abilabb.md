Week-long course where high school students could familiarize themselves with the different subjects available at Åbo Akademi University (e.g., chemistry and physics).

Supervised the portion of the course regarding analytical chemistry. The material covered water sample analysis using different techniques:

- electrochemistry
	- pH
	- conductivity
- titration
	- chloride content using precipitation titration
	- water hardness using complexometric back-titration
- electromagnetic spectroscopy
	- iron content using UV-vis spectrophotometry

The course is usually organized each August and I have participated in the supervision since 2015 (except for 2020-2021 when the practical lab work was not organized due to COVID-19). The course is in Swedish.
