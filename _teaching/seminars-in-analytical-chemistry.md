Thirty-minute presentations on some subject pertaining to analytical chemistry.

In 2019 my topic was "Ion-selective electrodes; past, present, and future" and covered various important events (e.g., investigations regarding electrostatics and electrical conductors) and people (e.g., Walther Nernst, Max Cremer, Zygmunt Klemensiewicz, and Phyllis Kerridge) in the history of ion-selective electrodes (ISEs). More recent examples (e.g., the discovery of conducting polymers and the development of methods for determining unbiased selectivity coefficients) and future prospects were also covered.

In 2020 my topic was "Acetate-selective electrodes based on novel macrocyclic ionophores" which was what I was working on at the time as part of the PhD thesis work. This presentation covered some aspects of receptor design, synthesis, and characterization as well as the preparation and characterization of ISEs. My recent research results were also presented as part of this presentation.
