Supervision of lab exercises involving glucose biosensors and chronoamperometric measurements.

In 2017 the exercise involved the preparation of the biosensors from scratch using Prussian blue-modified screen-printed electrodes and a glucose oxidase. The electrodes were first used to prepare a calibration curve for hydrogen peroxide. Then a glucose oxidase, bovine serum albumin, and chitosan mixture was drop-cast onto electrodes. These further modified electrodes were then used to prepare a calibration curve for glucose and finally they were used to determine the glucose concentration in a complex sample (e.g., sports drink).

In 2018 the exercise involved the use of commercial glucose test strips with both a commercial glucometer and with a potentiostat. This was used to demonstrate the operating principle of glucometers and the construction of the test strips. The test strips were used to analyze blood samples (both before and some time after intake of glucose) and recovery drinks. The concentrations determined using chronoamperometric measurements, which were performed with a potentiostat, made use of a calibration curve prepared with glucose solutions with a sodium chloride supporting electrolyte.

The course is organized each autumn and is in English. I supervised the lab exercises during the two years mentioned above.
