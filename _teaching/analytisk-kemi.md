Supervision of a lab exercise involving microwave digestion of hair samples. The samples were then analyzed by someone else using inductively coupled plasma combined with either mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), but I graded the lab reports.

The course is organized each autumn and I supervised this lab exercise from 2017 to 2020. The course is in Swedish.
