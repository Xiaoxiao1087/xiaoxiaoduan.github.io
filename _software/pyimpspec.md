`pyimpspec` is a Python library that provides an application programming interface (API) for working with impedance spectra:

- load experimental data from various file formats
- process spectra (e.g., mask outliers and make corrections by subtracting a baseline spectrum)
- validate spectra using Kramers-Kronig transforms
- analyze spectra using equivalent circuits and by calculating distributions of relaxation times
- simulate the impedance response of circuits
- visualize spectra and analysis results
