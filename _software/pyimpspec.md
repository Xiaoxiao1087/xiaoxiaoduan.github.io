excerpt: "Python API for processing, analyzing, and visualizing impedance spectra"
---

An open-source Python package that provides an application programming interface (API) for working with impedance spectra:

- load experimental data from various file formats
- process spectra (e.g., mask outliers and make corrections by subtracting a baseline spectrum)
- validate spectra using Kramers-Kronig transforms
- analyze spectra using equivalent circuits and by calculating distributions of relaxation times
- simulate the impedance response of circuits
- visualize spectra and analysis results

Those who would prefer to use a graphical user interface (GUI) may wish to use [DearEIS](https://vyrjana.github.io/software/deareis), which is based upon pyimpspec, instead.
