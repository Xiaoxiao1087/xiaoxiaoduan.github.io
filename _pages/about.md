I'm a PhD student at Ã…bo Akademi University and work in the field of analytical chemistry.
At the moment, my main research topic is the development of ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) for anions such as carboxylates.
I have an interest in material sciences and electrochemistry, particularly electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

During my bachelor's studies, I started programming as a hobby after a mandatory course and was later able to apply this knowledge to quickly process large amounts of measurement data during a summer internship.
This experience combined with my participation in the video game modding scene spurred on my interest in programming and open-source software.
These days I mostly use Python for my data analysis and visualization.
I have also published some open-source software for working with impedance spectra.

During my free time, I like to listen to music, play the electric guitar, and read books. I mainly listen to and play metal but also, e.g., some folk music. Terry Pratchett and Isaac Asimov are my two favorite authors.
