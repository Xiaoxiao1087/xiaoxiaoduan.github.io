I am Duan Xiaoxiao, a fully-funded PhD candidate at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, working on **digital entrepreneurship** and 
**returnee entrepreneurship**. My doctoral research, supervised by Dr. WU Qiaobing, focuses on the **identity construction of returnee
entrepreneurs**. I have maintained a GPA of 4.0/4.3 throughout my PhD program. Prior to joining PolyU, I completed my MSc in Applied Gerontology at Nanyang Technological University, ranked 19th globally by QS in 2023, with a GPA of 4.40/5.0. I also hold a BA in Japanese from China Foreign Affairs University, where I achieved a GPA of 3.64/4.0.

I have several manuscripts in progress under the guidance of esteemed scholars.  My involvement in these manuscripts reflects my dedication to conducting rigorous research in the fields of digital entrepreneurship, returnee entrepreneurship, and related topics. By collaborating with experts from diverse backgrounds, I aim to make meaningful contributions to the academic community and society at large."Specifically, I am collaborating with my supervisor, Dr. WU Qiaobing on two key manuscripts:
1) **Identity Construction of Returnee Digital Entrepreneurs in Rural China** - This manuscript delves into the identity work of returnee digital entrepreneurs in rural China. We are currently preparing it for submission to the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ), aiming to contribute to the understanding of this understudied yet vital segment of entrepreneurs.
2) **Identity Changes of Returnee Digital Entrepreneurs in Rural China** - This manuscript also focuses on the identity aspects of these entrepreneurs, likely exploring different facets or dimensions compared to the first one. We are preparing this for submission to a reputable journal such as the Journal of Business Venturing (JBV), with the aim of further enriching the academic discourse on the fluidity of identity.

Additionally, I am involved in two other manuscripts in collaboration with diverse research teams:
**Manuscript on B Corp Adoption** - This manuscript, co-authored with Dr. CHANDRA Yanto and Dr. JIN Qian, explores the adoption of B
Corp principles and practices among businesses. It contributes to the growing body of knowledge on sustainable and socially responsible entrepreneurship.
**Manuscript on Veteran Social Entrepreneurship** - This manuscript investigates the social entrepreneurial activities of veteran entrepreneurs. It sheds light on the factors that influence their decision-making processes and entrepreneurial endeavors.

Besides, I am also involving  in the inquiry of **anti-poverty entrepreneurship**.

My research methodology is diverse, encompassing both **qualitative and quantitative** approaches. In terms of qualitative research, I am adept at utilizing **netnography** and **visual participatory  methodologies** to delve deeply into phenomena. 
Complementing my qualitative skills, I also employ experimental designs and survey questionnaires to collect data for quantitative analysis. Furthermore, I can also integrate **machine learnin**g techniques, particularly **sentiment analysis**, into my research.
